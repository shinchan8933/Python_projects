# In the above code, I am first taking a string user input, then I am using the split() function in Python for splitting the sentence. Then I declared a new variable ‘a’ to store the acronym of a phrase.
#Then at the end, I am running a for loop over the variable ‘text’ which represents the split of user input.
# While running the for loop we are storing the index value of str[0] of every word after a split and turning it into an uppercase format by using the upper() function.
